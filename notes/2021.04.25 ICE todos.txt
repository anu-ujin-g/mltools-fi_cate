- Calculate d-ICE using ICE dataframe
- Finish the fit (all) and plot (all) functions for both ICE and d-ICE
- Test ICE class
	- Other independent variables
	- Other datasets
	- Same dataset, multiple models. See if differences in model captured by ICE plots
- Currently not using seed_num to do random sampling in ICE class. Fix that.
- Currently takes ~25 seconds to fit the "Age" feature for the cancer dataset. Try to reduce that.
